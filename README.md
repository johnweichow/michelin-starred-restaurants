# Scraping and Analyzing TripAdvisor Reviews for Michelin-starred Restaurants in the US
A work-in-progress script to scrape and analyze TripAdvisor review data.

Done so far:
1. Pull tables of Michelin-starred restaurants from Wikipedia
2. Find TripAdvisor urls of each restaurant
3. Scrape full-text reviews from each TripAdvisor url

Still need to:
1. Refactor code
2. Analyze review data (feature engineering, EDA, clustering)
