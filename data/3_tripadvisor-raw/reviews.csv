Exquisite.","I was more surprised than I expected. The restaurant was small but with really well used spaces. Jack and her wife explained us the story of how the restaurant became a reality. They were very kindly and friendly.And of course the food... excelent. I have no other words but excelent, tasty and beautiful.It's important to make a reservation with enough time because the place it's just for 10 people. You choose being in a table or in front of the stove, which I recommend. A great experience, no doubt."

Alexa, one of three employees at 42 Grams, called us to make sure we were still coming. When I said we were right outside getting out of a cab, she was waiting for us outside to welcome us in. This is a VERY PERSONAL dining experience. You will either have 8 people sitting at the chefs counter or 8 sitting at a table - THAT IS IT. This is not your everyday restaurant with multiple tables. It is truly an experience.With every dish that came out from Jake Bickelhaupt, Alexa provided a wonderful back story. The dishes are going to change so it isn't worth telling you about all 14 courses other than to say every single one of them were unbelievable. The portions are just big enough to give you a wonderful taste but small enough that you are not stuffed by the end of the fifth course.42 Grams is no longer BYOB and they have a small wine list but it is fantastic. Alexa does a great job of helping pair the wines with the courses that you are having for the day. We ended the evening chatting with Alexa and Jake - it truly is that intimate. How many restaurants give you a one-on-one experience like this?? None! We have dined at all of the best restaurants in Chicago. This is now our favorite and we love that it is in our neighborhood. Thank you Jake and Alexa for a wonderful meal - we will definitely be back again and again!"

Each dish is tremendously creative and very well thought-out. The husband and wife team who run the show at 42 Grams have certainly worked very hard to earn their two stars! In addition to the amazing food that Chef Jake serves his guests, he and his wife Alexa go out of their way to make you feel like you are having dinner in their own home. With only 8 total guests at each seating, you quickly become friends with the other guests which really adds to the atmosphere. We visited 42 Grams on a quick weekend trip to Chicago to celebrate our anniversary in October. We could not have been more happy with Jake's creations and the overall experience! "

But what it lacks in the usual ""luxuries"" it totally makes up in the quality and quantity of all ten courses. Every dish was bursting with flavors and of excellent quality. Of the two chicago restaurants with two michelin stars, 42 grams is much superior as far as the culinary experience."

A progression of courses starting from the sea, and ending with dishes from the land.Each plate was very luxurious and unique in execution and presentation. Hats off to the chef on his balance of textures and flavors, he has clearly spent years perfecting this skill set.I hope to one day return with my wife so she can enjoy this creative culinary experience."

The reception by the hostess (wife of the chef) is friendly but cold, Then we were also cold in the restaurant. And every hot dish was served lukewarm, which is a real shame. The chef is good and has some magnificent creations, but I never had the 'waw' factor. Creative, and special ingredients, of top quality, tasting very good but not exceptional, not the quality I expect from 2 Michelin stars. I dine in Michelin star restaurants across the globe and I can compare. Being from Europe, we are not used to BYO. Upon walking in, I wanted to hand the bottles to the hostess, she gave them back to me and said ""we will do this later"". In a Michelin star restaurants, I expect a courteous answer and I expect them to take the bottles, even if it is not the way this is normally done. Also, we notified 3 days ahead 1 person was not eating foie gras. The reply was we offer omissions but no substitutions. If I pay 250 usd per person for a meal, I expect service and should be offered a substitution. Again, service unworthy of a Michelin star. The hostess acts as a robot and is totally unfit to be in hospitality. The chef cooks in front of the counter - 8 seats - which could be fun if he interacted with the diners. He is shy and does not speak. This is of course OK, but I do not understand why you run a restaurant for a small audience, which looks like you are receiving people in your living room, and then you do not say a word. The hostess explains every dish to the 8 diners, but she sounds like a tape. My conclusion, definitely not the right value for money. Good but not exceptional food, and service which does not make you feel welcome."

The various dishes in the tasting menu were all experimental in the sense that they explore facinating combinations of ingredients and preparations. But the selection of ingredients is not facinating just to be different for its own sake. It's because the characteristics these ingredients bring the entire experience to the pinnacle of fine dining.This is undoubtedly one of the best restaurants we have ever experienced.As we mentioned previously, it's not a business dinner. This is for foodies or people who want to expand their culinary horizons.And it's communal (whether at the table or the counter) so it's not romantic in the traditional sense of a very quiet table with a great view. However, the combination of the food, the other diners, and the hosts make it a very interesting experience that will give you plenty to discuss both during the meal and afterwards. An unforgettable experience."

Like the best meal your friends ever made and no work on your part other than bringing a couple of bottles of wine. It could be this was the best meal I've had factoring in many variables - and ignoring rib-fest and CTA construction. Booking a table was easy via the website. Payment was all inclusive and in advance so absolutely no surprises. Suggestions for which wines to bring were well in advance and very clear. Husband and wife team seem a great match - he is a man of few words (maybe none on our visit) and she is expressive and approachable. The influences are distinctly Asian with a touch of Midwest sensibility. Portions were good for a tasting menu of 10+ courses and only rarely did it seem rushed. It seems inappropriate to give away any of the experience. all courses were surprises. They have a ""signature dish"" so I'll tell you that - A5 Miyazaki Wagyu. Thanks Jake and Alexa - until we meet again. Also, for Michelin followers - I think this was about the least we paid for a Michelin restaurant. Really worth every penny. "

And I mean that in the least pretentious way possible. The open kitchen, small staff and intimate dining room create a really friendly atmosphere. Alexis is a fabulous, down to earth hostess who takes the time to describe each aspect of the dish as well as how to eat it (intended to be one bite, etc.). The food is unreal, equally beautiful as it is delicious. It is very apparent how much creativity, detail and heart goes into each dish. It should be a must for both Chicagoans and anyone visiting the city."

Place seats 18 but they only take 8-10 at a seating. Didn't read that anywhere before. They used to do this in there apartment but decided two floors of stairs was probably not a good idea so now it's in the ground floor with a new name. Super creative food with textures, flavors, colors, and secret surprises in every dish! Alexa serves and explains each dish. Husband Chef Jake takes meticulous care in placing each component carefully in place, along with his assistant Chef. For us, it was a bit fast paced and I would have slowed it down by 30-45 minutes but I get it for the next seating. A total of 8 sat at the bar for the first seating and then we all left, they cleared the bar and then sat the second group at the table, I was told. We didn't see the second seating,milk let due to the delay in timing it. I missed two pics but included the rest."

If you want to feel like you are in a friends home, and you can let loose a little def check 42 Grams out. I'd say arguably the food here is even better than Grace and Acadia. Some people will really enjoy the more casual atmosphere. I certainly had a great time, and its nice to have some high end restaraunts that are more casual along with the more formal ones.The chefs personality really shines through his mouth watering, gorgeous food. And a great thing about this restaraunt is that the head chef is right next to you preparing your food, so if you have any questions you can just ask. Several courses were just the perfect combination of yummy, beautiful, and unique. In particular, the lamb dish, the miyazaki, the dessert, the squab, the mussels, the shrimp. Can't recommend enough. Least stuffy and least corporate restaraunt you will ever go, and possibly the most delicious/"

The atmosphere was not at all as expected and, in my opinion, took away from the overall experience - I really can't see myself returning. The seating was a tad too close, one of the stools was broken, we did not have any interaction with the chef, and a little too much interaction with the hostess. Here's what bothered me the most - and I know this may not bother some people in the least - the fact that many things being plated were being served from, re-heated in, or poured from plastic containers. I know it was necessary to prepare many of the ingredients in advance, but using cheap plastic containers to store, heat, and plate from (especially when your customers are sitting right in front of you) is strange. There are a few things that I store in my refrigerator at home in plastic containers, but I would never re-heat food in them or place hot liquid in them!"

In short, the best high end meal I have enjoyed in Chicago. Each course was memorable, service was amazing and it was worth every penny (approx $210 pp). Reservations Reservations can be booked online which also requires payment. When booking, you have the option of selecting the chef's table (counter top seats where the magic happens) or communal table (lower seating with a slightly larger group). You will note the chef table seating and communal table times differ. Meaning you will enjoy your meal with 8-10 ppl tops! Very intimate.BYOBYou are provided sparkling or still water. All other beverages must be brought in. What distinguishes this place from other BYOB Michelin rated restaurants like it ----- is that about 48 hours before the meal, an email was sent with wine pairing recommendations for each course to be prepared during our dining experience. It was three of us, so we opted to each bring one bottle from the list and share. I also picked up the Allgash Curieux a/k/a beer (yes BEER) suggestion for dessert. Ultimately, this was more than we could ever drink especially when planning to drink beverages paired with each course. Meaning we offered our drinks to the five others dining at our sitting and they ending up doing the same. .... Our dining experience lasted about 2+ hours.LocationThe exterior of the building is less than flattering. There was no valet parking and no parking lot which is pretty on par with all the others too. What matters is the inside. Cute! Even the bathroom was cute --- and had I brought my phone during my ""visit"", I would have took a picture. 42 Grams is located near Demera Ethiopian Restaurant. ..... GPS brings you right too it and so will a taxi. Lol BackdropIf I recall correctly, the chef and his wife are the heart and soul of 42 Grams. Speaking of souls, I think the name selection is because a soul is 21 grams and times two - get it?! The chef is fond of Graham Elliott and prepared a course inspired by him and used plates from his restaurant to accompany the course tribute to GE. Dining at the chef counter allowed us to see each course being prepared and to ask questions in free form. I suspect the same could be done at the communal table but I think the counter is better suited for it. While many look at the price of this type of meal and attempt to weigh its value by the quantity/size, it does not consider this type of business is a true labor of love. The ingredients, creations and size makes this type of place unlikely to be a huge cash cow, especially when both husband and wife are it. That said, I doubt any chef in this type of setting does it strictly for the money. You have to dream about creations to succeed even at a hefty price point. Knowing this, leads me to appreciate the talent and gift all the more. In sum, if you can afford the price tag, it is a great place, particularly for a special occasion. Highly recommend it."

We did in October 2015.Although the soul of the place is still intact, with very nice presentations, well-researched courses with ingredients coming from all over the world... it lacked the heart this time around.Last year, Jake (chef) and Alexa (hostess) had two people helping them, one in the kitchen and one for the service. This time around, it was only the two of them... and it did alter the experience.The whole purpose of having this setup (which they had themselves explained during last year's dinner) was to, not only be able to present exquisite food to their guests, but to exchange with them. Hence the ""communal"" aspect of the restaurant.This time around, that aspect was completely left out. Jake was so absorbed by his preparation and cooking that he never once exchanged with the guests, nor even bothered finding time for shaking our hand or taking a picture at the end of dinner. I will admit we were in for the first of the two seatings and he most likely had to prepare the 2nd seating.... but still. On her end, Alexa was always caught up in either explaining the dishes (in a rather pre-taped emotionless manner), distributing the said dishes and picking up empty plates. This prevented her from having the time to manage the guest's wines pouring, pairing (which was done the previous time). When experimenting with the dishes, sometimes you hit it out of the park, sometimes you keep coming back to your classics and sometimes, you miss. All three apply to the current menu. While the snail caviar, sea urchin and sturgeon courses were impressive... the wagyu, coffee and pallet cleanser were back on the menu as what seems to become their signature dishes, which no one could complain about... and finally, the ramen and veal courses were definitely not up to par.The overall experience remains nonetheless interesting at $250 / person (incl. tax and tip)... if the duo gets back the help it once had. If not, this becomes just another 10+ course restaurant with a view of the kitchen... without a heart... and a dying soul."

At an art museum a tour guide takes you from piece to piece and offers some background to help you appreciate everything. That’s pretty much what happens at 42 grams. Hostess Alexa Welsh presents you with (about) 13 elegantly prepared delicacies one-at-a-time and explains why each offers more than what meets the eye. For example, the organic Irish salmon owes its melt-in-your-mouth texture to being brined in a Lapsang Souchong tea. And the sphere of dark chocolate should be tapped from the top with a spoon in order to fully enjoy the Earl Grey tea inside. Even though the food was sensational, a key highlight came afterwards when Chef Jake Bickelhaupt mingled with the guests. He told me that food is his personal passion and serving food to others is sharing a very intimate part of himself. He basically tells that to everyone by the name of his restaurant, 42 grams, which is the physical weight of two souls (his and Alexa’s). One sign that this restaurant is special is that, as of this date, it hasn’t received any Trip Advisor ratings below five stars. Try pulling that off in a fussy foodie town like Chicago!"

Were seated at the counter with two friends and four strangers with a full view of the intense but fluid preparation of 13 courses carried out by Jake and helper Emily. Wife Alexa serves as an emcee for the evening, making sure you're settled, have what you need and understand what you're about to eat. She was a bit intense at first but then seemed to relax as the evening got underway. The food is all simply amazing and beautifully plated. Courses came out in fairly rapid succession (I wouldn't have minded had it been 5-10 percent slower) but we were never rushed. Our total experience lasted about 2 1/4 hours.

The amazing thing was that each of the courses was distinctively different, but the flow of the evening was never jarred by a discordant element.Yes, the restaurant is pricey and the reservation process might be a bit off-putting, but it is fantastically worth it.Reserve, go and expect miracles of dining pleasure.

I think that's great; why eat at someplace that's exactly the same in a dozen other cities? Give me an original meal that expresses THIS chef's vision, whether it's tacos, Italian beef or high end cuisine. Even more exciting is when a chef can remove the ""4th wall"" of separating the diner from the kitchen and do away with the pomposity of fine dining that can be off-putting. How about one of the best meals you've ever had in a small, dinner party atmosphere that is casual and fun? This is the dining experience at 42 grams. Google the restaurant and you find tons of reviews as this place has been written up almost continually since it's opening in Jan of 2013. I'll just give you a couple of tips.1) Check out the Last Minute Reservations tab on the website to score a seat2) Note that the price is a fixed $185 for the multi-course meal. Tax and a 20% service charge is added when you purchase your ticket (it's $243 total). You can leave your wallet at home..there is NO other charge3) It's BYOB. After you buy your ticket, you'll be emailed wine recommendations for a white, red and dessert. I love this for a few reasons: it's fun to bring your own choices, both as a cost savings and a way to use what I have in my cellar. If you're from out of town or need to supplement, a nice reason to visit one of Chicago's quirky wine stores (House of Glunz on Wells, since 1888 in the same location!)

This place won't be up and comming for long as it is a wonderful experience that only a selected few can enjoy every night. With 2 seatings a night (1st is a counter seating of 8 people at 6PM ; 2n is a table seating of 10 at 8:30PM), you really feel priviliged to be welcomed into chef's Jake kitchen. His wife, host Alexa, makes sure to explain everything composing and where the courses come from... all 14 of them.Beyond the tasty, well presented and very well researched food courses that are offered to you, what enriches the experience is the fact that you have to exchange with the other patrons... and the chef / host.Best of all... it's a BYOB with very reasonably priced suggestions that best pair the menu (which is seasonal). The restaurant even sends the recommended selections via e-mail a few days ahead of time. We would recommend to bring both a white and red bottle, as the hostesses will serve you the best one that pairs every course.We took part of the early counter seating... and it was awesome to exchange with the chef and look first hand at how the courses were prepared... and all the love and attention Jake and his sous-chef put into it.Definitely a must-go if you're in Chicago. And hurry... as this place will have a 6-month waiting list soon."

Prior to opening 42 Grams, the two operated an underground restaurant out of their apartment, called Sous Rising, where they eventually invited 10 guests 3 nights a week into their home for a large tasting menu. They are attempting to recreate that feeling in their new restaurant, 42 Grams. There are 8 seats at the chef's counter that are all sat at the same time. These diners get a front row view of the action in the kitchen and complete attention during their entire meal. Once the counter is finished eating, the guests for the 10 seat community table begin to arrive for their very own dinner party. Seating each group separately allows for the entire restaurant's attention to be on one dish at a time and the needs of only a small number of guests. Their system works flawlessly and really shows customers that they are cared for.42 Grams is a BYOB fine dining restaurant that presents guests with some of the most beautiful food I have ever seen. Each micro green or edible flower has a purpose. They aren't simply there to look pretty. They have a specific flavor that amplifies every course. Each dish is plated before you with extreme care and elegance. Every single bite was stellar and impressive. There was not one flop or disappointment during our entire 14 course menu. I could not more highly recommend eating at 42 Grams."

But we went on two different occasions, once to sample the widely publicized burger at the bar and the seven-course tasting menu that costs $185 per person. Located at 1638 South Wabash Avenue in Chicago's South Loop, it is an upscale restaurant serving North American dishes inspired by chef Ryan McCaskey's background in coastal Maine. His culinary brilliance has earned two Michelin stars. Enough said about the quality of the operation. Open at 5:30 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday and at 5 on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, Acadia has been attracting rave notices since 2011. Be sure to try the burger. It's only served at the bar. It features two patties, gruyere, bacon onion jam, truffle mornay and pickles. I'm not big on tasting menus--it's fun for the chef, who loves to create many new dishes but I usually prefer lots of a few things rather than bits of many things--but McCaskey's version is comparable to Patrick O'Connell's tasting menus at the Inn at Little Washington and Patrick has three Michelin stars. We especially enjoyed the black bass, Maine lobster, smoked potato, scallop, buttermilk biscuit, lamb, coconut sorbet and black sesame custard. Tasting menus are becoming more and more popular at upscale restaurants so we have to get used to it."

My husband and I have eaten at Michelin star restaurants before, and we were expecting Michelin quality. The service was great but the food was underwhelming and sometimes almost inedible. The ice cream sandwich with caviar made no sense, and there was no taste of caviar in the dish. The main lamb course had absolutely no flavor; it was barely seasoned. The potatoes were undercooked in the “breakfast” dish. The dessert at the end was inedible. It was supposed to be a sea buckthorn berry dish; however it had no taste of the berry whatsoever. This sounds very harsh but the dish honestly tasted like mouthwash. The lobster and squash dishes were good but that’s only 2/10 dishes!! In addition, the meal as a whole had no cohesiveness whatsoever. We were incredibly disappointed and we were not expecting this for a Michelin 2 star restaurant, and now wondering about the quality of the Michelin rating system. In addition, the meal was >$500, so I would have expected much better quality. Definitely not worth it and I would never go back."

Lots of room for improvement.","Okay here it goes my serious review of Acadia. For some background, I’m an avid restaurant goer and have dined high end and low end across the world. I live on the west coast and my palette is generally craving for freshness and flavours that are not overpowering. Over the years, I have dined in Michelin one to three star restaurants, including 2-3 star highlight tasting menus at Arzak in San Sebastián, Michael Mina in Vegas, L’Atelier de Joel Robuchon in Paris and Guy Savoy in Paris. My experience at Acadia was overall a positive one. The service was absolutely superb even though I have have been served by all of the six servers at the restaurant throughout the meal. They seem to take a team approach rather than a personal approach which I didn’t mind at all because each one of them were professional, courteous, friendly and attentive. Nope, I didn’t get paid or had given anything bonus (not even the wagu beef) to say this.So I have much to say about the food. The diplomatic way is to say that there is much to improve. There’s so much to improve but the food is good, don’t get me wrong, but I probably won’t return for it. My favorites were the fois gras and truffle dish which had corn and blueberries at the bottom. I thought that the blueberries were a surprise and a nice move. I also liked the smoked scallop and tomato dish even though the “smoke” flavour was a little boring. The tomatos were super delicious. The sheet pasta with lobster and king crab dish was not bad (even though it was underwhelming since I own a pasta machine and I can definitely copy this at home). The white asparagus was too old and I had to spit out two pieces. The matcha bread I liked. The fermented corn ice cream with roasted corn I was pleasantly happy with. I absolutely loved loved loved the final donut with caramel. That was a perfect echo to the first dish and tribute to Chicago style churros and caramel popcorn. The meal really should have ended there and I thought the last McDonald’s looking berry tart that came with the bill was not necessary. Here are the parts where they can improve on. The risotto was way too salty. I sent it back once and the second time was almost just as salty. They timed it perfect at al dente but was way too heavy handed with the salt or picked a cheese that was too salty. The duck was cooked so so, had a good portion, but that miso and curry combo really really was screaming for acid. The confit potato in that dish made me yawn. That dish was screaming loudly for some pear or apple, or even apricots. The main entree was underwhelming. The pork many ways was alright, very “Chicago” which I appreciated, but you expect everything to come at the right temperature when you dine at a Michelin Star restaurant. Everything on my dish was about room temperature to cold, so it was not really a main course I would jump up for. Finally, In my opinion the meal lacked cohesiveness and progression. I liked the “donuts” at the beginning and end, but dishes in between did not have anything to do with each other. The foie gras dish was just added to where it is probably because it is a cold dish. It was a little frustrating. The pastries were also quite frustrating. For example, in the pork many ways entree, I didn’t understand what the two breads had to do with each other and what they had to do with the pork dish. What was that piece of seaweed doing in that butter other than it being something Japanese just like matcha in the matcha bread. Finally, the water drop at pudding at dessert was funny to see in a two star Michelin restaurant. It is a snack in Asian cities that you eat on the street or in street markets (low end food), and it’s a fad that’s dying. It could have been elevated but I didn’t think they did other than added some micro flowers.All in all, I must end at a positive note and say that Acadia is not as bad as all the reviews on Tripadvisor. I didn’t have to spend an extra penny considering the ticket online already included tax and gratuity. Is it two star Michelin? Probably not yet in my opinion, but I think overall it was still a decent meal. Was it “wow”? I think foodies out there have been spoiled. There were some slight wow moments for me from a few dishes but overall it was “alright, not bad”."

It is an understatement to say that we unhappily surprised by both the subpar food and service. The highlights of the meal were a little bread roll (combination brioche + croissant) offered towards the beginning of the meal, and the lobster course... that's 1 course out of 10!!! It isn't that the rest was all bad; it's just that the food was unremarkable at best, and out of balance at worst. We never did find the foie gras in the 3rd course. I tasted each offering and the waiters happily cleared my uneaten portions from the table without asking about why they were not eaten. My husband and I have eaten in many Michelin starred restaurants all around the world and at many small establishments that have great service. There is no excuse for a restaurant of this caliber to be so bad at serving a meal, especially when almost everyone is being served the same 10 courses! We started the evening with a female waitress who served a couple of courses. All of the other courses were served by other, varying waiters. This would have been fine if it had been properly choreographed; but it resulted in uneven timing and no one really keeping track of the overall experience. The female server returned at the end of the evening and was surprised to learn of our unhappiness, stating that she wished that she had known earlier... we wished that she had known earlier too! The ambiance was the saving grace of the evening (lovely dining room and quiet enough to hear one another). You can imagine our surprise when the check arrived with tax and gratuity already included and not discernible. We agree with other recent Trip Advisor ratings (e.g., ""Expensive and Disappointing"", ""Falls way short of Expectations"", etc) and we will not return. In all, dinner cost $575 (we brought our own bottle of wine) and we actually went home hungry... that is a real shame."

I don't usually eat at Michelin rated eateries so I was excited about this reservation.My spouse and I were here for the Easter brunch buffet. In general I don't like buffets for many reasons. Nevertheless, based on reviews and the Michelin rating I thought the food here would be upscale and the menu would include items I have not tried before. There was a practical but limited selection. It is better to have less that is prepared well than more that is substandard. The quality of most of the food was good. The potatoes and mac n cheese were very good. The take on chicken and waffles was interesting. The sausage and bacon - standard issue nothing special. The lobster benedict was okay. The cocktail shrimp and crab legs were good. There was also ham and lamb which I did not eat because I don't eat either. There were some 'luxury' selections like foie gras and caviar but I just don't like the taste of either so I passed on those. I did not understand the rice or pasta selection. Let me preface my service comments by saying that the omelet station was manned by a very nice young man and the omelet was good. I also had a conversation with, who I believe was the head chef. He was a nice man who took the time to speak with me briefly even though he was busy. I appreciated his time and gave him my thanks for working so hard on Easter. I would also like to say that water was filled consistently. My issues with this restaurant are as follows:- Wait staff - some not as good as expected. The restaurant was very busy because it was Easter and our waiter did not seem very attentive. I believe the waiter's assistant or 'valet' was annoyed because he was overworked. I asked for a cup of tea with honey and after a wait he came back and said he would try to find some. Okay - so as not to 'over work' him further I asked for sugar instead. He comes back with 4 packs of sugar substitute. I don't use that so I ask for 'real' sugar and I guess he had to go search for that as well. He came back with some very old looking sugar cubes. Okay. Then I had to ask for more hot water. We ordered two mimosas but were never asked if we wanted another round. I asked for a clean napkin - never got it. I felt like I was being a burden and the atmosphere at times felt 'hectic' and 'chaotic'. Disappointing for a 'Michelin' rated eatery.-A la carte buffet: All drinks expect tap water were extra. Okay so charge $110 instead of $95 and provide orange juice and coffee. Mimosa's $15 each and tea $7. Okay. Then if you want a few pasteries for the table add another $11. I really didn't want the carbs but come on. Let's keep it real. Give people a croissant and muffin and include that in the price. Dessert: one small piece of the desert of the day-no selection. Everything is extra. It's all about the dollars. - The check: I know that these types of eateries are expensive. I don't typically like 'fru fru' or uppidy places. I'm very down to earth but I do like well prepared food. With that said my spouse did not want me to see the bill and for good reason. In addition to the $95/pp, we had to pay for all drinks, the 21% automatically added gratuity, tax and get this 'health insurance."" In my lifetime I have never seen a restaurant charge for health insurance. If we are talking about a stellar staff okay, ask my permission first, then I'll pay. However, I want to pay for what I get. 21% off the top without getting feedback from the customer isn't fair. I always tip at least 20% if the service is good. On top of gratuity the restaurant owner wants us to pay for the staff's health insurance. I can do if everyone is friendly and doing their jobs but if they are acting like they don't want to be there, they are inattentive, or a bit arrogant then we have a problem. After seeing the bill all I could say was 'WOW"". That's bold. In summary I can't recommend this restaurant because for me I don't feel I got the 'experience' paid for. There was much lacking. We had to wait 15 minutes for our table and the car valet was no where to be found. Please research restaurants that require you to pay for your meal upfront because you will get charged even if you don't show or try to cancel. Also review their billing policy if available online. I don't recommend going on special occasions because the place gets crazy busy and you don't get the individual attention you'd expect.The staff spends more time with customers who buy additions, liquor, etc. The more you spend the more attention you get. I think that's sad because some people don't drink alcohol."

I would probably give it 3.5 stars if it didn't have any Michelin stars.To begin, we had a reservation for four for the tasting menu at 5pm on a Friday night. We arrived about 10 mins prior to our reservation only to find that the door was locked. We noticed a couple sitting at the bar inside and there was staff walking around but we were forced to wait outside in the bitter cold until 5:02 when the doors were opened. Prior to the beginning of service, our server confirmed that we had one individual in our party who had a gluten allergy. To a preference for no gluten, but a ""I will be in the bathroom all night if I eat gluten"" allergy. Then the amuse bouche comes out and lo-and-behold it's sitting on a fried pastry shell. We ask the server if this contains gluten to which they respond they don't know and will ask the kitchen. They return to say that there is only a small amount of gluten and ""you should be fine"". I felt that if this would have been a peanut allergy, it would be absolutely ludicrous for a chef to say ""there is only a tiny bit of peanut in there, you should be fine"", but that is the response we received. This process would repeat itself again when the petit fours were brought out and one consisted of a layered chocolate tort. We again asked if it contained gluten, the server returned to the kitchen to ask pastry and then come to inform us that pastry said there was only a tiny bit of flour and that it shouldn't be an issue.Our last service issue was when our second dessert course was brought out. It consisted of ice cream, with a white chocolate sphere, and what I believe was green matcha bread. The bread-free plate was served to me and not the individual who was actually allergic. I didn't notice until I was almost done with the dish and looked around to see the matcha bread on other peoples plates but not mine. The individual with the allergy received the plate with the bread. My wife and I have dined at a handful of Michelin stared restaurants to include Alinea, Per Se, Le Bernardin, Joel Robuchon, and Boca. All in all, it was just not service that one would expect from a Michelin starred restaurant. We are not pretentious when it comes to fine dining and I have never actually complained to a restaurant because I don't think I am qualified to critique a chef, but if there was ever a time when I wanted to more than ever it was during this dining experience. As for the food, it was very underwhelming with one dish barely palatable. The standouts for me were the lobster in the Tom Kha inspired sauce (I'm a huge Thai food fan so me enjoying this was surely a given) although it's presentation left a little to be desired. The other was the main dessert course discussed above. The pasta dish with white truffle and bonito flakes was insanely over-seasoned. The truffle was not fresh and provided no savoriness to the dish, and the dish was extremely over-salted to the point that it was inedible and I like salt. Often in my cooking my wife claims that I over-salt my dishes but this dish was on another level. Lastly the Wagyu supplement for $65 was not only a waste of money but was a terribly composed dish of what is otherwise a great cut of protein. The beef was literally served between two pieces of grilled white bread accompanied by some mayo and greens with a lemon. I lost a little faith in Michelin that night as a reliable restaurant reviewer. Had this restaurant not had any stars and was a quarter of of the price I would have chocked it up to be an off night with a new kitchen possibly rolling out a new menu. However, when a restaurant has two stars and you are paying what you do, you expect to have a level of service and food that is commiserate with their Michelin rating and for Acadia, they just did not deliver."

Mission accomplished. After only 10 months, McCaskey's Acadia was awarded its first Michelin star. In 2015, it claimed two Michelin stars. In 2012, it received the Jean Banchet Best Restaurant Award. In 2016, it earned five stars from Chicago Tribune restaurant critic Phil Vettel. It also has received a AAA Five-Diamond Award. What's next? Three Michelin stars? Located at 1639 South Wabash Avenue in Chicago, Acadia is an upscale, posh restaurant serving North American dishes inspired by McCaskey's boyhood home, coastal Maine, specifically Penobscot Bay. It is open from 5:30 to 9 on Wednesday and Thursday, from 5 to 11 on Friday and Saturday and from 5 to 9 on Sunday. Like many Michelin-caliber restaurants, Acadia offers an eight-course tasting menu. It is a growing practice that my wife and I became acquainted with at Patrick O'Connell's Inn at Little Washington in Virginia. As O'Connell explained, it affords the chef an opportunity to explore and experiment with many different dishes, not just a few. McCaskey's menu included a Hudson Canyon scallop, fire-roasted cabbage, a Stonington lobster, Chinese duck, pappardelle with truffle parmesan, whole wheat sourdough, Elysian Fields lamb and lime panna cotta with apple gel, match cake and apple ice cream. For $165 per person, in an intimate and romantic setting, you can't beat a fine dining experience at Acadia."

Don't be fooled by the unassuming frontage of this nondescript location. The experience within is superb, from arrival to departure. Our group was not looking for the full gastronomic experience that can be had with one of the tasting menus, after all it was Halloween, so we opted to be seated in the bar area. Our server, Nicole, was immediately attentive, cordial, and clearly there to curate our dinner. After beverage service, she returned to take our order. She was one of those uncanny servers who could tell the absolute most appropriate time to appear and disappear. I ordered a salad and a burger, but what I received was something akin to paradise. The salad was artfully constructed in a manner reminiscent of an architectural drawing with the appropriate precision. More impressive than the presentation was the delicate blending of subtle flavors, rarely found in a dish as light. The burger was anything but what the name might suggest. It was as good as any aged ribeye I have had in a fine steakhouse, and it was adorned in a complex array of flavors that left the palate in a state of wonder. If I had any criticism, and it can't really be one when ordering a burger, it was a little too rich. My fellow diners had the short ribs, lobster roll (well, it is named Acadia), fries and a small treat. Perhaps the most impressive moment of the entire evening was when Chef Ryan came out to our table to check on our meal. He was the most cordial and convivial culinarian I have ever met. I can't wait to go back and try the full dining experience. It must be unbelievable."

You won’t hate the food but won’t love it either. Not worth the price tag and gives Michelin a bad name. Plus the service is not great. I usually love most restaurants, from French laundry and Gary dankos to chains like the Cheesecake Factory and random burger joints. I was excited to take my wife to a Michelin star restaurant during our weekend in Chicago. I called for reservations but they were booked, however we were told we could sit in the bar area and order everything from the main room. So we headed out on an hour ride there and arrived hungry and ready to try everything. Upon getting there we realized the restaurant was empty. There was only one other couple and a random single guy at the bar. Most of the people were staff. (A place that isn’t packed is a red flag but it has a Michelin star so we figure it should still be awesome). When we tried to order we were informed we could not order the large multi course menu, only a la carte. I explained to the waiter that we were told otherwise over the phone. He went to check with the chef to see if he could accommodate us but it was too much trouble, they would not. So we ordered a lot of items a la carte. The drinks were pretty but too sweet and not Michelin pretty. We ordered based on the waiters recommendations and the food was just okay. The portions were fine but the food wasn’t Michelin quality either. They used expensive ingredients like lobster and lots of truffle oil but they didn’t put them together in a Michelin quality way. Everything was just okay and disappointing. The staff raved about a burger that was the best in Chicago but ended up being somewhat insipid. The lobster roll was good but nothing I couldn’t order from a food truck. Presentation was not good. It was just all around not a great experience. The food was on par with the Cheesecake Factory, maybe slightly below, and the service definitely subpar. Maybe their head chef had the night off, I hope the owner reads this and fires the manager or chef who was there Oct 27, for the sake of his business. Anyway we ended up going to the theatre to see Hamilton and stopped by a random place next door to it with some old world charm. We ordered some food there and it was absolutely awesome. Maybe Acadia set the bar so low that anything would have impressed us by that time. If you’ve never been Michelin please don’t come to Acadia, you’re going to throw away your money. There have got to be better Michelin star restaurants in Chicago that will give you an out of body experience. I wish Acadia was one of them but unfortunately they will disappoint."

We are in Chicago fairly often, and I try to stay current on restaurants in the City. Over the years, some of our favorites have been Alinea, Everest, Charlie Trotter, Next and now Acadia. They had not made my “radar screen,” but the Concierge at the Fairmont Millennium Park recommended them highly, and I found him to be quite the “foodie,” though I rather dislike that term. Here, it fit. They also had been awarded 2 Michelin stars, and I normally keep a close watch on such. This reiterated how useful a good Concierge can be.We arrived for our reservation, and were promptly seated. We started with some Champagne, The Taittinger La Francais Brut, and the Pierre Paillard ""Les Tres Roses"" Grand Cru Extra Brut Rosé, while we looked over the Seven-Course Tasting Menu.We elected to go with the wine pairings, and were glad that we did. While I know my way around a wine list, and while Acadia had a lot to offer, I did not know the chef, or the kitchen, and sometimes that knowledge can significantly impact the chosen wines.Our decision made, we just sat back, and had a glorious night.Our Tasting Menu consisted of:Parmesan Thyme Cookie w/ truffled Bavarian puffed beef tendon and ramen packetGournay cheese, pâté à chouxCod brandade and Cheddar saltine – these were served on cross-sectioned logs, with the crackers in a beautifully folded napkin. An outstanding starter, and visually arresting too!Seeded Beer Bread w/ Animal Farm Butter – though not from an extravagant bread cart, like say Jöel Robuchon, I do not think I could have made a better selection, and I love breads.Asparagus w/ rhubarb, brioche and Osetra caviar – an exquisite dish, and I am not a big asparagus fan. We were certainly off to a great start.“Chicken Salad” w/ liver mousse, “Miners” lettuce and mustards – the kitchen was on a role, and we had another winner.“Ravioli” w/ pastura con trufa raviolo, ram, morels and sauce Normande – note here, that some of the course titles are in quotes. Those come from the menu, and also signify that the dish is a deviation, or maybe even a departure, from what one might normally expect, from just the title. In each case, the deviation, or departure worked beautifully.Spanish Octopus w/ piri piri, olive and Anson Mills cream peas – possibly the best octopus that I have had, with an excellent texture. I know Anson Mills, (I was in the room, when Glenn Roberts received an achievement award from Southern Foodways Alliance, at Blackberry Farm, for his “heirloom products”), but was unfamiliar with their Cream Peas. Just a spectacular dish.Yukon Potato “Risotto” w/ leek fines herbes and black truffle – another quotation, and another departure, but a very successful one.Potato Bread w/ dill, allium butter – but I was not done with my Seeded Beer Bread! OK, time to let that go, and try the Potato Bread. Though not from a bread cart, someone was doing a great job with both these breads, and the butters. Keep it up guys, you have hit, after hit going.A5 Miyazaki Beef w/ hon shimeji, miso potato purée and furikake – The beef was excellent. It, alone, should have 3 Michelin stars! The prep was interesting, and complimentary.Foie Gras Gateau w/ strawberry, pistachio, rhubarb and fennel – I am a big fan of Foie Gras, but it was lost in the Gateau (rice cake), but then the other ingredients stepped up, so it was not really missed.Papaya w/ honey milk and Yuzu tapioca – OK, I am much more of a Cheese Course guy, and usually share that with my wife, getting only a taste of her dessert. However, this dessert might just change my habits.We finished with “Variations of Chocolate” in an array, Dark, Milk, Caramelized White, Beet and Mint – here, the quotation marks are my own. This was a fun course, and whoever heard of “Beet Chocolate?” I had not, before this night, but now have something to look for.The wines were:Cantina Adriano Gewürztraminer, Alto Adige ‘15Azienda Agricola Barone Cornacchia Pecorino Controguerra. Abruzzo ‘15Domaine DuBois Bernard & Fils Aligoté (the “lost grape” of Burgundy, and one of the best examples of that varietal, that I have ever had) ‘14Château Puech-Hout Rosè “Prestige” ‘17 from the LanguedocWinzerhof Stahl “Edel” Chardonnay Franken ‘15Emmanuel Darnaud “Mis en Bouche” Crozes-Hermitage ‘16Emilio Bulfon Moscato Rosa Friuli ‘14Marenco Brachetto D’Acqui “Pineto” Piedmont ‘16And I had added the two Champagnes, at the start of the evening.We kept many of our wine glasses, for several courses. Not to test the Sommelier, but to have the opportunity to taste each dish, with several wines. Our spacious table accommodated all beautifully, and after asking if the Champagne glasses could be removed, to which I replied “No, not yet,” the glasses were completely untouched, until completely empty, and moved to the side of the table.Service was impeccable, as was the pacing. Nothing was rushed, and there were no noticeable pauses. While the waitstaff was always about, they basically went unnoticed, until a new course was being brought out. It was perfect, and worthy of that third star.The venue is interesting, in that it is a bit of “industrial modern,” but then with several Asian elements. Our table was very comfortable, and all around us were well-spaced, allowing very easy access to the servers. The lighting was very good, and I prefer good lighting over a table, as seeing a presentation is highly important to me.For the overall experience, it was more like the late Grace, but with a bit of Atelier Crenn (San Francisco) for the presentations. They were not as dramatic, or as interactive, as say Alinea, a restaurant experience, which we greatly enjoyed – much more subtle.Since we have fairly recently dined at many Michelin-starred restaurants, Alinea, Grace, Quince, Pétrus, Galvin @ Windows, Campton Place, La Bernardine, Restaurant Daniel and the Minibar by José Andrés (plus his É in Las Vegas), and then Jöel Robuchon and Guy Savoy in Las Vegas, I can honestly say that Acadia is one of the best dining experiences we have had. They are THAT good.The portion sizes are adequately small, but then there are seven, plus two bread courses, so we did not leave hungry. The wine pairings were excellent, for the dishes, and while not the highest-end we have experienced, perfect for this evening.If I had only one complaint, it would be that my beloved “travel camera” was malfunctioning, so that many of the dishes will not be depicted. That has been fixed by the Canon repair staff.As a PS, I collect menus and wine lists from many restaurants. They function as notes for my reviews, and as mementos of dining experiences. The menus from Acadia were fantastic, beautifully presented in a folder, with a sting, and a seal. Recently, at a Michelin 2-star restaurant in London, I was told “we do not provide menus, or wine lists to guests.” They proposed sending me an e-mail, with all details, but in 15 mos, that has not arrived. Acadia had no such problems, and were proud to provide ALL details, for a wonderful evening. I hope that I thanked the Fairmont Concierge enough for this reservation."

But then you realize you initial bites are on the branches. From there on the service is done in concert by the servers and each plate is delivered and removed together with a detailed description of the courses. All dishes were paired with uniquely selected wines. Every one was just enough to enjoy the flavor profile, but not overfilling. A wonderful experience that left us sated and relaxed."

The first is whether to have a drink in the bar first. Our recommendation is definitely yes - and order a 'carte blanche' cocktail: you choose your core spirit, and the barman creates his own cocktail around it. One of us chose gin, the other rum, and we were both delighted with what we received.The menu, since January 2018, is a 7 course tasting menu, with an option to add an additional course before dessert. In addition, a couple of the courses require you to choose between two or three different options. All in all, this isn’t hard to get your head around.The final question is whether to go for the 'wine pairing', or choose other drinking options. We chose the former, to give the restaurant free rein.Every one of our courses was excellent. More importantly, every course was unusual. To give one example: if you had offered me a dish focused on a scallop, white chocolate and grapefruit, I would have laughed. But in practice it was superb. As a second example, we were surprised to have a fiery, spicy course at the mid-point of the meal - but again it worked superbly and didn’t detract from the succeeding courses.And the wine pairings (which in our case were primarily Italian with a couple of French selections thrown in) were excellent choices in each case.So a clear 5 star review from us.That said, there is always room for improvement. To reach even greater heights, we would humbly suggest Acadia look at the following:1. The room. It’s just not exciting - though it is less impersonal in reality than its photographs suggest. P2. The allocation of servers to tables. Halfway through our meal, the gentleman who had introduced every wine and food course up to that point disappeared, and someone else appeared in his stead. The reason was that issues elsewhere meant that the team swapped servers rather than keep us waiting. But, having built a rapport with 'our' server, it was disconcerting that he suddenly disappeared. We would rather have waited a while and maintained continuity.3. Approach to tipping. We were given the bill, and were told it was 'all in'. It was clear that 21% service / tip had been added, and we had no issue with that. But when our card was run, I was invited to add an 'optional additional tip'. This just seemed weird. Please either leave the tip to me, or suggest what I should pay - but please don’t suggest what I should pay and then ask for more afterwards.But these three points are minor quibbles.Overall, this was a wonderful experience, and we will definitely return."

The difference is stark in terms of atmosphere , taste and experience. Each will suit some types of people but I don't think each type would enjoy the other. If you like one of them you are unlikely by nature to like the other.So I think you can guess Acadia is not going to come out well on this one. However on the positives there is a clear sense of occasion and the food is very pretty and ""Michelin"" looking. The dining room is a cool space and the waiters all look very smart and are very attentive. i caught a glimpse of the kitchen on the way in and saw a chef with tweezers doing something to a plate of food , this was a clue as to what was to follow...It pains me to write a negative review when I can just partially appreciate the incredible amount of man hours and skill that must go into producing the picture perfect dishes that emerge from the kitchen . We had the seven course tasting menu and stunning looking dish after the other were put before us. However there were two key elements missing. Taste and warmth (on the dishes that needed to be warm). The crab dish , oh my goodness is looked like a Picasso from the art museum . However it did not really taste of anything , it was frankly insipid . The Cauliflower that had been cooked sous vide with foam and all sorts of fancy bits was stone cold. Cold veg is not an easy one. The Duck dish again was beautiful looking but stone cold. The Poached lobster was over cooked and not deveined, I would not care that much but with the aspirations of this restaurant and the prices I do care.I am sorry , it was not worth the money or the time for me. Lots of people were there and seemed to be genuinely enjoying the experience . As I started by saying , it would provide a sense of occasion for a special treat however it was not for me. I loved Smyth , please see my review , and I suspect the people enjoying Acadia would not ."

And I understand it is not main stream and it can be expensive. I have been privileged to dine many times at Tru, Alinea and Oriole among other stellar restaurants in the Chicago area and have always come away with some very fond memories.As you anticipate I am about to eviscerate Acadia.But before I do, in all fairness I did a a little research online and those pictures and food/service descriptions do credit to their establishment and prop up their 2 star Michelin rating.But dear God our meal tonight was just awful.Even though up front we had purchased tickets (included a 9 course meal and wine pairing for 3 - over $1K) our host started off by trying to up sell us with a wagyu beef dish and cocktails. We declined.And so the ordeal began. Plate after plate showed up beautifully presented (but not quite as beautiful as the pix on line). And I do believe that a lot of hours had gone into the preparations but somehow the all the flavor had been worried out of it in the kitchen. Tasteless is the one word that I will associate with this meal forever.The Amuse Bouches which should just have wowed us seemed tired at best. Many courses were presented with the poor servers having to add meaningless drops of sauce at the table which could easily have been done in the kitchen. Bread seemed to be a big deal (it comprised a couple of courses) but it was adequate at best and there were some muffin biscuit ""rocks"" that we were served at one point which would have caused the entire kitchen to be sent home from Top Chef. Proteins were pretty awful - pork cheeks had no flavor (honest I made a better prep at home last week) and the lobster tail was very tough - sadly have had much better on cruise ships. And the pork ""Cracklin"" was anything but - it could have been used for a Space Shuttle tile.Also the wine pairing was kind of insulting. Most of it did not match the food except by accident. Yes it was exotic but I felt like I was being duped into paying high prices for international wines that I could not pronounce or find on line easily but most of which were probably pretty inexpensive. And the icing on the cake was that coffee/tea service was an extra charge.Maybe the chef is on holiday - but don't go any time soon..."

From the outside, everything looked promising: small sorta non conspicuous entry, hot developing area on the south loop, and the Michelin Star. The restaurant itself was nice and cozy, and a relief from the frigid cold. I ordered the lobster Benedict, and was pleasantly surprised by the chef's complimentary pastry plate, and thought ok so far. Then my dish came out, and the muffin was stale and cold, as well as the dish was mostly luke warm. I ate some of it but sent it back to get it reheated. Even with the reheat, the flavor was a bit on the bland side and the lobster was overdone. I don't plan on going back. Maybe other menus are good but it is not somewhere where I had a great first impression. "

But I thought Acadia was an upscale, high-brow restaurant that emphasized Chinese duck, pig heart tartare, Hudson Valley foie gras and Tasmanian ocean trout, not hamburgers. But a visit to Acadia, which is located at 1639 South Wabash on Chicago's South Side, reveals that it is much more than that. Hamburger joints don't rate two stars by Michelin. As such, Acadia is one of the top five restaurants in the Chicago area. It also offers a tasting menu, a sampling of a lot of tasty items that is becoming very popular at quality restaurants across the country. Another exceptional feature of chef/owner Ryan McCaskey's restaurant is the impeccable service and the presentation of each course. Do you want to know the story behind Golden Thai snapper or Indiana duck or Maine seafood Tom Kha? They'll tell you. This isn't a place for traditional food. No shrimp cocktail or Caesar salad. It's an enjoyable dining experience for discriminating diners who want to sample different a host of fresh and innovative and delicious culinary creations that you won't find anywhere else. I was especially impressed with the Tiger shrimp and Tasmanian ocean trout. I was reluctant to order lobster because it is too rich for my blood, like crab cakes, but my wife was persuaded to give it a try. She wasn't disappointed. There isn't anything more fresh than Maine lobster. Acadia knows how to prepare it as if the restaurant was located in Gloucester. But I'll stick with shrimp and trout and a chocolate/lemon dessert. And the hamburger. With two Michelin stars on the front door, they must be doing something right."

You enter into a sophisticated small bar area with all the latest Japanese liquors and few of the typical name brands. I thought ""uh-oh"" this place might be too foo-foo for me, and I was right. The bartender was less than friendly and we opted not to order drinks. Our wait wasn't long and we were led into a nice size dining room where simplicity reigns with no table cloths and little on the tables. Clearly the restaurant has an Asian theme and there were many servers in attendance, but the wait to get some food was way too long. Water came quickly and nothing else for 10-15 minutes. No bread, no nothing.And then we began our 5 course tasting menu. I've found that tasting sometimes means you'll leave the restaurant hungry and that sure was the case.The truffle cookie was good, as were 2 of the 3 others in a box. The lobster roll was tasty but truly bite size, the cured tuna was bursting with flavor and my taste buds were loving it; but the olive bon bon was absolutely terrible and spoiled everything. Yuck! Don't know who thought that was a good idea. The cavier, potato soup was in the smallest thumbnail bowl possible but delectable. I was getting worried because the portions were so small. The Thai peanut soup was ok but the lobster was underwhelming and the pheasant ravioli was terrible. I purchased the Miyazaki beef for an additional $75 and it was good, but for $75 it was terribly overpriced. The little stories the servers told you about the chef inspired dishes was interesting, but without more food was an exercise in futility. The chocolate and deserts were adequate, but for a restaurant that clearly is catering to an upscale crowd, it was a big miss for me. Much too long a dining experience and overly expensive considering we left hungry."

We ate at another restaurant the night before and were blown away by that. I have to admit, I was upset about the whole lead up. We had reservations nearly a month in advance for Sunday for a birthday celebration. A week before they called and said they were suddenly closed for maintenance. How was that not anticipated? Strange how that happened considering they require you to purchase tickets in advance. Katelynn went to a lot of effort to reschedule with another restaurant and fit us in for Saturday but it was an inconvenience given we had guests flying in from out of town. No other accommodations were offered for the inconvenience other than we could cancel. HmmmmIn total we added 5 drinks to the tickets, one more wine pairing and a Wagyu beef dish that somehow added $250 to the prepaid bill.Now on to the food and service..the melon dish was bland and unimaginative. Molecular gastronomy and agar are passé unless the flavor was intense or unusual because T this was boring. The Wagyu beef was warm and not hot and we had 4 to share ( they said that was ok) but there were only 3 small pieces for $85.But thank god we ordered it for our 5 course meal because that was insufficient but due to our late seating were not able to order the largerTasting menu (in hindsight, glad we didn't). They were not even aware of which tasting menu we ordered and asked us despite ordering this well in advance. Poor communication. Water glasses were not filled through the evening. While you might expect this at a lower caliber restaurant, we found this surprising. The lobster roll was good but not exotic or innovative. The chicken was tepid and had an unusual consistency. The cucumber frozen dessert/intermezzo pictured below was novel but I have to say that I can't remember because they never offered us a menu as a souvenir as is so typical of restaurants of this caliber. Cardamaro was one of the wine pairing offerings and actually delicious but at a cost of about $15 a bottle, not something you would expect from a 2 star Michelin restaurant with an $85 wine pairing. On top of all that, it was a birthday celebration with nothing special to truly mark the occasion. I feel I'm being generous in giving 4 stars but not interested in ever returning. "

The restaurant itself is quite bland in appearance. The service was just OK, but given you are required to pay a 23 PERCENT GRATUITY IN ADVANCE one might expect more. 23 percent. In advance. That's pretty aggressive by anyone's standards. The food was nicely plated and good, not great. Certainly not two-star worthy. But where Acadia truly failed is in the wine pairing. The shortest pours I've ever seen. I'm not looking to get smashed at one of these, but for $85 you got little more than a glass of wine (five pours). The wines themselves were good, I really wish I could have enjoyed them. To top it off, the somm had a jacket full of smudges and stains. At a two-star restaurant, you really need to have your somm in a decent looking jacket, don't you think?Acadia just picked up its second Michelin star this year. Not sure how on earth that could have happened, but I think it's going to put a lot of undue pressure on this place. Expectations are going to be very high. And Acadia will not live up to them. I wondered why it was so easy to get a reservation on a Saturday about two hours before I visited. Now I know..."

They also served us 3 ""pre-appetizers"", a pre-dessert and little cookies after; so our total was 10 different dishes.As noted in other reviews, the portions a very small.

The wine pairings were well-chosen and described. The pours were only a couple ounces; so despite drinking six different wines we were in no way impaired (or over-full) when we left to drive home.The service was exceptionally competent. Even though one of our servers was on his first day he was clearly a well trained part of the team.The negatives: although safe, this location is several blocks south of the trendy South Loop restaurants.

Having eaten at a number of Michelin star restaurants around the world, it's always great to try new places that Michelin has determined is upping its game.Acadia did not disappoint. Having the 10 course tasting menu (which included a number of pre, mid, and post dishes not included in that count) was a good experience. A small number of dishes were just exquisite; most dishes were very good; and a small number really missed the mark (the asparagus and the lamb tenderloin). Most of the wine pairings were done well, but there were a couple of misses. When the sommelier explains that people either love or hate the Chinato--maybe it's not the best choice for a forced, matched pairing. They did comp me a glass of port--which worked much better with the dish--but, things just need some small tweaks.The only real downside to the evening was the service. It was certainly not bad--it just wasn't up to the high standard that I would expect for restaurants of this caliber. There were a number of mis-queues where a dish came before a wine pairing; a waiter came and removed a glass that someone had just set for the next pairing (twice); and folks just seemed new (maybe 50% of the staff). Every restaurant has to train its staff, but the polish on all of the service was not there--and it showed and ended up detracting from what would have been a great experience.With all of that said, Acadia is still definitely deserving of a rating of 5 on TripAdvisor and 1 Michelin star. The chef still is experimenting with and refining new dishes; not all of them will hit the mark, but a stagnant chef is far worse. Refinement of the service should continue to evolve, but it's something that will have to be watched. If you're looking for a fine dining experience in Chicago, do check out Acadia. You'll enjoy the food."

Since this place as gotten 2 stars in the michelin guide, we thought this would be an exciting place.This restaurant may deserve a bib gourmand, but no stars. The place was very noisy as there was no door between the dining area and the kitchen. The interior was cold. The waiters were very professional, and the sommelier was the main attraction of the evening.We had a 10 course tasting menu with wine pairing. I've had similar in several one and two star michelin restaurants. I was disappointed. The food in it self was very good, the wines were paired good, and the sommelier told us many interesting facts about the wines. However the courses were so small that we never really felt like we had been eating, they were no larger than a carnappe in other restaurants, the wine were in matched size. The fancy stuff they usually do with some courses in such restaurants basically lacked. It felt like we were stressed trough the set, as they were rushing food and plates in and out of our table. All in all a good meal, especially the main course and the dessert was amazing. However; even for a tasting menu, way to small courses. Price was stiff, probably worth 2/3 of what we paid."

At a restaurant of this caliber, there should never be a need for me to be turned around in my seat looking for someone….ANYone….to come attend to our table. That being said…if you are a burger fan, it is still worth a stop here to try the Acadia Burger. Excellent meat and unique condiments, perfectly topped with Gruyère cheese.

We asked for a cocktail menu since a friend had told us the bartender was very thoughtful and inventive. The menu was short but had fascinating and unusual drink preparations. After ordering our drinks, the waitress brought us the dinner menu. There were two tasting menus, one on each side. The left, $95, was five courses. The right, $165, was for twelve courses. We chose the shorter menu but with all the little extras (three amuses bouches before the first course), bread, an extra dessert and sweets afterwards, it came to at least eleven courses! The tables, decor and food presentation were restrained but elegant, tasteful. It was quiet enough for conversation even when the restaurant was full. The food was very good, some dishes even great.

Acadia is my first 2-star restaurant and it did not disappoint. My SO and I opted for the 5 course chef's seasonal tasting menu with wine pairing and it was absolutely outstanding. The courses went from lighter to heavier as did the wines and we both really enjoyed each course. The menu was very unique with a good combination of traditional methods and more modern molecular gastronomy themes (and heavy on lobster which I appreciated). The service was outstanding as would be expected from a 2 Michelin Star Restaurant, but it was not as starched or ""up tight"" as some others in its class (e.g. Tru). Apparently Chef McCaskey's philosophy and mission with Acadia is to bring Michelin Guide-quality food and experience to the masses, and quite frankly, from a cost perspective, there's no question he has achieved that with Acadia. With the tasting menu and wine pairing and a cocktail to start, it was still an incredibly reasonably priced meal (considering the quality and reputation). I highly recommend, and so far, Acadia has earned its spot as one of the best restaurants in Chicago, and perhaps the best value of a Michelin starred (or two-starred) restaurant I've ever been to."

The food while impressive to look at, was just so-so. I appreciate the level of culinary artistry here, but the food still has to taste good and in most cases, the food along with the wine pairings felt disjointed and mis-matched.

I have been to a number of Michelin Star restaurants, but have never encountered service that is so impersonal and cold. I enjoy establishing a friendly encounter with the wait staff, but this was challenging at Acadia. There were so many different wait staff coming to the table that it was hard to have a consistent interaction with someone. Our main waiter also initially argued with whether our Groupon included a wine pairing or not. I once asked what type of glassware the restaurant uses as it was quite nice. He did not seem to understand the word glassware. I asked whether a menu could be printed out at the end of the meal, but he forgot. I also felt that the wine pours were rather stingy and unevenly poured between myself and my partner. These may be pedantic concerns, but I feel that a restaurant of the caliber of Acadia should be perfect especially in terms of service."

The duck was a little overcooked, but otherwise everything was excellent. Our dessert was also light and delicious.

Four of us (two couples) tried Acadia at 5:45 PM Saturday; the only later bookings available were after 8 PM.We walked there; our coats were checked and my wife and I waited in the bar area for our other party to arrive. Acadia has subdued, ""minimalist"" decor; clean, horizontal surfaces with indirect lighting (see the Acadia website). Slightly spoiling this relaxed feel was the somewhat frenetic, a little too loud, background music. We were seated at a large, square black wood table for four. The chairs are not good for dining. For one thing, the carpeting made chair movement difficult. The chairs themselves are cloth upholstered with a sloped back that offers no support when you're actually eating. Tables are well-spaced for relaxed dining.We had five different 1st courses: celery root risotto, butternut squash soup, scallops, veal sweetbreads plus the charcuterie ""for the table."" The butternut squash soup is as good as it gets; the wild boar terrine in the charcuterie was a solid chunk and crumbly; difficult to apply on toast points, but flavorful and more than compensated by a silky chicken liver mousse that was over-the-top good. The celery root risotto was different, for sure; little cubes of cooked celery root that tasted like a risotto. Not as flavorful as you'd expect; maybe traditional rice risotto concentrates the flavor more? The sweetbreads were good; tender and rich. Ditto the scallops which had a sublime white sauce, maybe pureed parsley root. I'm sure the waiter told us what it was, but every dish was unique, with a lot of components, easily confused.For our 2nd course we had scallops, lobster, ""Indiana duck"", skatewing and venison. As you can see from the Acadia website and reviewer pictures, portions are not overly generous, but very attractively presented. Acadia combines divers types of foods into a colorful ensemble that enhances flavors and provides contrasting textures. The skatewing, for example, was served on roasted cauliflower florets. The Indiana duck had beets and mustard and little curried roasted carrots (which tasted too salty). Sauces are also on the skimpy side, which is too bad because they're quite good.Parker house rolls were served as a ""bread course."" These and the accompanying whipped maple sugar (I think) butter with cinnamon were amazingly good.We all had desserts but the menu descriptions were deceptive. A ""sweet potato custard"" had these little pieces of cooked sweet potato and other ingredients which didn't seem to include custard. Ditto the gooey butter cake had virtually no cake, and the chocolate pudding cake had no pudding. They were, however, delicious. Service at Acadia is extraordinarily good. Attentive, unobtrusive waiters kept glasses filled, accurately described the dishes, answered questions (""what is that green centerpiece?""). We'd got one 1st course, the charcuterie, ""for the table"" and without being asked, the waiter got us more toast points. With two glasses of wine, two coffees, five 1st courses, four 2nd courses and four desserts, we figured our bill was about 80% higher than the French bistro restaurants we typically frequent. We'd return for sure, but it would have to be a pretty special occasion."

For one thing, it looks like and tastes like no other. I'm not into Fois Gras or martinis but I am into hamburgers--as you know, I'm partial to White Castle--and when one noted restaurant rating service tapped Acadia as ""the best fine dining"" establishment in Chicago in 2013 and AAA awarded Acadia a 5-star rating and another noted food critic rated Acadia's burger as the best of all...well, you have to stand up and applaud and take notice and stop by to check it all out, especially the burger. Acadia also was named one of the ""best new restaurants"" in Chicago in 2012. And Michelin, the international rating service, gave Acadia a top evaluation in 2013. Honestly, you don't receive those kind of accolades for the quality of your burgers. First of all, the burger isn't supposed to be the signature item on the menu. It's on the bar menu. At Acadia, most folks start with eggplant or oyster soup or Fois Gras Gateau, then order ribeye or cobia or lobster or Indiana duck ham. The bar menu also includes Vietnamese meatballs, mussels and lobster rolls. But chef Ryan McCaskey's always draws rave notices for his burger...three cuts of beef (chuck as the base, brisket for juciness, wagyu for scraps), housemade Applewood bacon, double creme Gouda cheese and bottomless layers bacon/onion jam and housemade garlic dill pickles with a side of potato salad. Acadia is close to the Chicago Loop. It features an elegant but understated decor, plenty of privacy if that's your pleasure, a lively bar, attentive service, not exactly the type of place you'd expect to find the No. 1 burger in town."

Four special lead in bites and then nine very unique, well presented, well prepared and well served selections. All were well explained, interesting and innovative combinations of ingredients. It would take too long to describe all the dishes but suffice it to say we enjoyed all manner of variations. The staff were very professional and very helpful. The location is in a non-descript building seemingly off the beaten path south of the downtown area but don't let the outside appearance deceive you.The evening was not for the budget minded but if you want to enjoy a special treat I would definitely recommend.

I had the lobster roll & a Moscow mule. Since I was dinning alone I sat at the bar. My Moscow Mule was exceptional !!!!! It was the perfect amount of ginger beer, lime, & vodka. The bartender told me that they make the ginger beer fresh on location. I was very impressed, That was the absolute best Moscow mule I have ever had. It took a very long time for my food to arrive, while I was waiting the bartender did not offer me anything. I fact, he did not ask if I needed anything else and he did not ask me how my drink was. The staff overall was very pompous & pretentious. I would have given a much higher rating if the service was better and the food portions were larger. My lobster roll was on a bun that had been brushed with butter & lightly toasted. It was very moist, slightly sweet, & fresh. The lobster was fresh and seasoned well. I do NOT like mayonnaise or sand which spread so they offered to make my lobster roll Connecticut style. Again, I can not say enough that the Lobster roll was perfection. However, my dinner was more like an appetizer portion size. A miniature lobster roll accompanied with 6 homemade dill flavored potato chips. I would visit this location again for drinks only as I love a good Moscow Mule."

We were attracted by generally good reviews since it opened in 2012, including one star in the Michelin guide to Chicago. It did not quite live up to our expectations.There is a bar at the entrance that looks nice; the main room is so minimally decorated with bare walls, generic furniture with bare tables and halogens on the ceiling that it looks like a glorified cafeteria. We were seated in the adjacent smaller room that is more intimate with at least one modern painting on the wall and chandeliers.We started with two cocktails, which justified the bartender’s reputation as a great “mixologist”: a “Local Agent”, vodka based with onion-flavoured ice cubes, and a lemony gin tonic with cucumber-flavoured ice cubes. Both were good tasting and strong, no Shirley Temples!The background jazz music was very pleasant.We dined à la carte since we had to get up early the next day for a meeting at the Convention Center.We had an amuse-bouche of goat cheese with two kinds of beets, rather banal in my view. I had a starter of foie gras “au torchon” with white chocolate, a bit unusual but tasty, the portion was quite small. My wife had a risotto with snails that was fine. Then came a small buttermilk biscuit with soft butter that tasted OK.My main course was a Storington lobster “pie”, consisting in a piece of lobster claw and a piece of tail, both tasty, with added bisque, and a rather tasteless pastry cap. My wife had a piece of halibut with artichokes and cucumber that was rather bland. The menu has only three desserts. We had the “miel” and profiterolles that were fine.We had with this an excellent bottle of Auxey Duresse 2010.The service was efficient, courteous and attentive.All in all a decent meal, at a cost of 276,87 USD for two excluding tip, but we did not think that it justified one Michelin star. To appreciate fully the chef’s talent, we should probably have ordered the 11-course tasting menu that costs 165 USD per person (plus 95 USD for pairing wines), a good reason to come back…"

Sadly, all the laudatory comments on these sites are a mystery as this was an average restaurant trying to pretend it's in the four star category but falling far short. The good: service was stiff but attentive and as someone mentioned on this site, a parade of wait staff to present and clear dishes is unnecessary. We began with an interesting oyster amuse whose sweetness was the overwhelming flavor. We ordered 2 appetizers: risotto and a charcuterie plate.The risotto was delicious, silky and redolent of lemon zest. The charcuterie plate was descent with a silky slice of chicken liver pate and a piece of pate de campagne accompanied by 3 razor thin slices of cornichon and a drop of mostardo and a balsamic sauce which were good but there was too little of it. The not so good:The entrée I ordered was truffled rabbit which was actually a tiny slice of roulade wrapped in bacon the size of a quarter for $32, which sat alone on a plate next to one ramp. The size was laughable and everything on the plate was so over salted that it had to be sent back. If this course was part of a tasting menu, the size wouldn't be quite as much of an issue but as an entrée it was laughable. My spouse's halibut was larger but tasteless with no accompaniments whatsoever sitting forlornly on the plate. Between courses, we were offered 2 very good buttermilk biscuits the size of a quarter which were warm and delicious and later, we were given 2 miniature lobster rolls which were precious things with good lobster inside stale rolls. Serving 3 amuses during a dinner adds to the fact that there needed to be fillers in order to create the impression that one has had a meal here.While the service was generous--they brought us a pour of prosecco to celebrate our anniversary, this restaurant doesn't deliver a true four star or even 3 star experience, and the mostly average food, no matter how artistically presented on a slab of what looked like astroturf can't make up for its shortcomings and its outsized prices. A miniardise at the end was the highlight of the dinner--a chocolate ganache cookie sandwich which was truly a standout. The wine we chose by the glass was a Willamette Valley 2011 Pinot Noir which was outstanding.Having eaten in some great restaurants with great chefs in several countries, I'd have to agree with other comments that this is not the place for sophisticated diners. There are many better choices in Chicago."

We had a la carte choices, including their signature potato ""risotto"", foie gras, the halibut, the lobster pie, and the beef (this one is by far the best meat dish I have ever had!). All of these were stellar. And the desserts were wonderful too; I'd recommend the delicate Miel. Some reviewers complained about the small portions. Indeed, the servings aren't generous (perhaps, as a timid suggestion, if they were just a tad larger, it would be absolute heaven), but then again you are here for the quality, not the quantity. And the 4 of us left full and happy even after the high price tag. Very, very worthy for special occasions."

For our entrees he had the lobster and i had the Sturgeon which was perfectly cooked and blended well with the other items and various drops of sauce on the plate...He felt the lobster texturally was a bit tough but reallly loved the thai style broth it sat on as well as the other elements on the plate..For dessert to be honest i can't tell you what i had or ate...it was just too deconstructed and texturally was just a bunch of small crunchy items in my mouth..My partner had the profiteroles and while they were not a traditional profiterole he enjoyed the dish a lot.

I'm not shilling for these guys. This is just a damned good restaurant with a carefully thought out menu and menu format. For us, the enjoyment started at the bar where we arrived early in search of a polite cocktail. I ended up with an artisinal gin and house-made, lemon-grass tonic on the side. Yummy stuff. And a decent sized pour. My wife's Cosmo was similarly innovative and of course, made from scratch. The price? Not the $19.00 a copy I expected, based on my years of hanging at the Four Seasons or Bar Boulud in New York City. But $13.00 apiece. A rare bargain, friends.But there the bargains ended, although the value remained. Acadia's food, fairly priced, considering the quality, is marvelous. The format is a three course prix fixe menu... first, second and dessert courses, all incorporating mostly locally sourced ingredients that reflect the chef's Maine (Acadia) heritage. We of course, immediately opted for the lobster, which was quite extraordinary, served in a sauce of seafood bisque and complementary seasonings. No lobster in Lake Michigan, you say? Who cares?We selected our own wine pairings, rather than take the restaurant's suggestions, although I have to admit, Acadia's recommendations looked quite smart. And a dessert of decadent chocolate pairings, coupled with a Sambucca, left us experiencing a delightful sugar high.My only complaint was the server's obligatory narrative accompanying each course - which is the norm in high end joints these days. At least, she didn't refer to the chef in the annoying third person... as in, ""tonight, he's decided to pair your Ostrich with...""If you're a foodie, put Acadia on your list.

The room is cold and stark, and the service obnoxious and intrusive. I have dined around the world, and have experienced truly world class service. From my perspective, that is service that attends to all of our needs without being overly visible or intrusive. Water, wine, and bread are refilled whenever required, but without pretense or show. At Acadia, everything is a ""production"" - and not in a good way. Having 6 waiters arrive at the same time to clear our appetizer course? Are you kidding me? Unnecessary, and quite frankly uncomfortable. I think there is good potential here, just need to back off of some of the overly ""creative"" food and rework the front of the house."

The majority of us had Foie gras as an appetizer. While a nice portion size, it was not even warm....the skin was even cool. When called to the attention of a server, we were informed that is the Chef's method. We have had Foie gras all over the world and never has it been basically cold. After to bringing this up again to another server, they were neither apologetic, sympathetic or caring regarding our displeasure. Once our entrée arrived, the same for the guests whom had ordered ""duck"". One of the guests had only 1 bite before placing her knife and fork down for the remainder of the dinner. The food if you can call it that was so minuscule that if you had piled all of the appetizer's and entrée's of 6 together, you might have had (1) entree portion.The decor was stark, their web-site says contemporary minimalist but that is stretching it. The location is hardly the neighborhood you'd frequent.Don't waste your money or your time. There are so many restaurants in Chicago that has great Chef's and great food.....this is certainly not one of them."

We absolutely enjoy fabulous food and have dined all over the U.S. The restaurant staff was pretentious and by the third dish we decided that it was time to leave...paying for & leaving our full bottle of wine on the table. We have never done this but after dining all over Napa, Miami, San Fran, N.Y., Chicago, Hawaii & other places, this dining experience was one that we could not endure. I made note of this to the Waldorf & recommended that they not send anyone else to this restaurant."

First off, a place that has been open almost a year should have a sign, but alas no, they do not have a sign. No biggie, we thought, its part of the mystique. It's true the menu is fairly limited and there was no bread or even a salad option. The flavors combinations were novel but not captivating and the portions were minuscule. Or, as one diner said at the end of our meal, "" Who wants to go to White Castle?"" With so many othe great restaurants in the city, I came to the conclusion that they have not put up a sign because they don't expect to last that long. Dinner for 4 with 2 bottles of wine was $400 and worth less than 1/2 that."

You are served a series of exquisite samples, each beautifully prepared and presented with such unobtrusive service. It was a delicious and memorable meal. If you are a finicky eater , you might not like it as each dish is prepared with many ingredients. If you are a big meat-and-potatoes guy, same. When you get the tasting menu, you don't know what each course will be until the bring it to you. I would rate it 5 stars but I discount because of the extreme high price - $95 per person."

But inside awaits a wonderful dining experience. The decor and seating are elegant and very comfortable. Though the a la carte menu choices were very tempting, we decided to put ourselves in the hands of chef Ryan McCaskey and sommelier Jason Prah and splurge on the 6 course Tasting Menu with matching Wine Pairings without even asking what that evening's menu consisted of. Ahead of us lay a wonderful gastronomic experience that spanned a wide range of truly inventive cuisine and delicious wine servings. Since the menu changes with the seasons, it would almost be pointless to list all the different taste sensations that were offered but suffice it to say it was delightful and fully satisfying. Definitely not inexpensive but well worth it for that special occasion."

Normally we would do that but were limited on time and thus were relegated to about 5 total choices. Presentation was beautiful, cocktails inventive, atmosphere fantastic, as was the service but not sure I would venture back unless I had the time to really savor the tasting menu with wine pairings.

We celebrated our anniversary there, and to meet our request, gave us a quiet table in a side room that was perfect. The service is excellent, everyone friendly but not pretentious. The sommolier recommendations were perfect with our courses. We did not do the six-course tasting with wines, however were very happy with our selections. Only two complaints: my first and second course dishes independently were outstanding; however they were way too rich when paired together. I would have appreciated the waiter indicating this when I ordered them, and steering me potentially to a different 1st course. Second, the desserts were only so-so. The pastry chef seemed to be trying too hard to be unique (e.g. PB&J Woopie pies as a parting small dessert with the check?!) The chocolate dessert presentation was poor, and tasted so-so. For desserts they should try going ""simpler"" to end a fantastic dinner experience on a really high note. Agree with the other reviewer that it is hard to spot this place -- be sure to take the street number with you, there is no outside sign.All in all, a very good evening for a special occasion -- we highly recommend Acadia."

Wonderful attentive service, beautiful presentation, and amazingly delicious. While each course was a work of art, it wasn't just complicated for the sake of being complicated, or presentation at the expense of substance. I'd like to say what the standout courses were, but reflecting on the menu makes me realize they were all standouts. I honestly can't pick a favorite or even top 3. The sommelier also deserves a lot of credit, as the wine pairings were perfect and really brought out the best in each course."

Inside is a nice bar area and a mid-sized dining room, very nice but without any unecesary nor exception frills. To my surprise, the menu was imaginative and everyting was excellent from the starter to main courses and exceptional desserts. Very extensive wine menu catering to all tastes and price levels. we had a $58 malbec that was excellent. Wines arrived very slightly chilled which is a nice touch and indicates a sommalier who actually knows what he's doing. One possible downside to some may be the size of the portions that tend to be very small. This is without a doubt a starter AND entree type of place. That being said the quality is such that the quantity can be forgiven though I would suggest to management a modest increase in sizes nonetheless. As said above this is a no-frills place so the bare walls do make for a high noise level though not excessive unless you have the unfortunately all-too-typical person who feels a need to share with all.Would I go back? Absolutely though this time I might be better prepared for the price which is a bit on the high side. Service is excellent, not rushed and very knowledgeable about each dish being ordered and presented.Very much recommended though with the caveats above which may not be what everyone is looking for. This is not a doggie back place is size is all that matters."

The atmosphere is trendy and pleasant, but the view of the vacant lot may be an accurate metaphor for a place that looks good at first, but up close fails. First, the portion sizes are ridiculous small. At best the piece of fish I ordered was 3oz, same for my wife. This also holds true for the salad, which was tiny, and really overpriced at $14. Second, the wait staff poses as knowledgeable, but the recommendation that ""this is moving well"" is not helpful. Unless you like trendy places, like to pay far more for the food than it is worth, and like undersized portions, I would not recommend Acadia."

We went on a Saturday night, and they dida last-minute switch to a Prix -Fixe Menu. Not too thrilled as we wanted to see the regular menu!!The modern decor and service were nice, but the menu was a let-down for us! The portions were so tiny despite being artistically presented. The wait time between each course got to be agonizing! The pea soup was a tad watery, the risotto (made with potatoes??!!) was unusualand a bit gummy, the pork belly was good-presented with foam-thought that craze was over!Biscuit intermezzo- ""Pilsbury"" flavor! The duck entree not great. Lobster pot pie a better choice, tiny tiny portion!! The dessert-poppy seed cake-was gray (yes, as in the color!)with basil ice cream- one taste and I was done. The expensive price for a few bites, don't thinkwe will be going back anytime soon. I was so looking forward to our meal there, huge let-down. Our server was very nice. He did get overwhelmed as the evening progressed as hehad three tables show up at once. Not fair to him! We saw the sommelier walking around, buthe never stopped by our table. The waiter not too well versed on the wines. There is a lot of waitstaff that dramatically served each course. It also was very loud. There was a table of four men who were having a great time, but were out of control loud!! When we left the host did ask us for feedback, but gave us a blank look and said ""well maybe you will give us another chance""-Don't think so. I would have thought the waiter might have noticed that I did notfinish even half of my selections. I was trying to be nice as he was trying so hard, but theyshould have noticed!Over $200.00 for two of us and we went home feeling like we had been taken advantage of."

The food was excellent and inventive, with beautiful presentations. We had the rabbit sausage (excellent, though the bacon wrapped around it was very chewy) and the Wagyu beef (excellent). The charcuterie plate is fantastic, as was the pea soup, though the bowl for the soup was so shallow it was hard to spoon up the soup! Great wine advice and some very creative and good cocktails. The service was friendly, attentive, and helpful as well. All in all a very good dining experience. The decor is a bit too spare for my taste and the restaurant was a bit loud; not a ""cozy"" atmosphere."

Most of the appetizers were all delicious, the charcuterie, fois gras, potato risotto, all very good. The crab appetizer was fair. Most of the table enjoyed the deconstructed lobster pie. It was simply fabulous. The rabbit entree was a complete disappointment. It was so tiny and not appropriate for an entree. Flavor, just OK. Dessert was a crazy and delightful journey. We tried almost all of them. If I had one complaint about this course, it would be that most were too complex, too many flavors going on.

My entree of shrimp and my husband's version of lobster pot pie were truly remarkable (translation---everyone horded and no one traded bites). We finished the meal with a lovely cheese tray.Service was perfection. The wait staff was knowledgable, friendly and never missed a beat.
